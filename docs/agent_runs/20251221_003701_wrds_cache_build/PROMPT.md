"build a real data cache, as large as possible and reasonable, very organized and everything we need for this project, whatever you think is the optimal way to do it, go and do it"

Context:
- WRDS credentials available via .env
- Store cache under /Volumes/Storage/Data
- No sample data; real WRDS only
