# Current Results

All headline metrics are now sourced from the reproducible snapshot at
`docs/artifacts/metrics_summary.md` (generated by `scripts/generate_metrics_summary.py`).

- **Tri-engine parity (BS / MC / PDE)** – see snapshot row (tri_engine_agreement) for current max |MC–BS| / |PDE–BS| and CI coverage.  
  Source artifacts: `docs/artifacts/tri_engine_agreement.{csv,png}`.

- **QMC vs PRNG (equal time)** – snapshot row (qmc_vs_prng_equal_time) reports the PRNG/QMC RMSE ratio by payoff using `qmc_vs_prng_equal_time.csv`.  
  Source artifacts: `docs/artifacts/qmc_vs_prng_equal_time.{csv,png}`.

- **PDE convergence** – snapshot row (pde_order) captures the fitted slope and finest-grid RMSE from `pde_order_slope.csv`.  
  Source artifacts: `docs/artifacts/pde_order_slope.{csv,png}`.

- **QuantLib parity** – snapshot row (ql_parity) captures max abs price diff (cents) and runtime ratios.  
  Source artifacts: `docs/artifacts/ql_parity/ql_parity.{csv,png}`.

- **Benchmarks** – snapshot row (benchmarks) surfaces MC throughput/scaling and equal-time ratios; raw JSON/CSV/PNG live under `docs/artifacts/bench/`.  
  Source artifacts: `docs/artifacts/bench/bench_*.{json,csv,png}`.

- **WRDS OptionMetrics (bundled sample panel)** – snapshot row (wrds) reports medians/weighted aggregates from the sample bundle; live WRDS pulls remain the source of truth.  
  Source artifacts: `docs/artifacts/wrds/wrds_agg_{pricing,oos,pnl}.csv`.

- **Coverage** – remains published at `docs/coverage/index.html`; not part of the metrics snapshot.

Re-run `WRDS_USE_SAMPLE=1 ./scripts/reproduce_all.sh` followed by
`python scripts/generate_metrics_summary.py --artifacts docs/artifacts --manifest docs/artifacts/manifest.json`
to refresh the snapshot alongside the deterministic artifacts.
